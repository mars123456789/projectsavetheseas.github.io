				<h2>INVISIBLE TO SOME, POLLUTANTS TO MOST.</h2>
				<p>Just because we couldn't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there. #ProjectSaveTheSeas is a social media awareness campaign to lessen the use of plastics by using alternatives to it. Research shows that by 2050, there would be more plastic in the seas rather than the fishes itself. What the fishes consume, we consume also. We should be well aware of its effect on us especially to the marine biodiversity. By supporting this page, and by sharing its content, you are not just helping on promoting the campaign, but you are also saving the marine life. Save the Seas, Save the Marine Biodiversity!</p>

				<h1>6 SOURCES OF WATER POLUTION:</h1>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>1. Sewages and waste water</h3>
				<img src="photos/sewer.jpg" alt="sewage image">
				<p>Inadequate sewage collection and treatment are sources of water pollution. According to the United Nations, more than 80% of the worldwide wastewater goes back in the environment without being treated or reused.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>2. URBANIZATION AND DEFORESTATION</h3>
				<img src="photos/deforestation.jpg" alt="deforestaion example" >
				<p>Deforestation has an impact on the quality of water flowing through the watershed and alters the discharge, chemical and physical properties of water. This paper presents the effect of deforestation on water quality, in particular on physical and chemical characteristics of water and evaluates the community based watershed management schemes in Buyhang micro watershed. The quality of water is assessed on the basis of laboratory analysis of various parameters by using weekly grab sampling technique from three alternative land uses and in depth assessment of farmers’ needs, priorities, and conservation practices</p>

				<h3>3. Ocean Dumping</h3>
				<img src="photos/marine dumping.jpg" alt="garbage on the ocean" >
				<p>Among all sorts of activities that pollute the ocean, dumping of garbage and other waste materials stands first in the list. Dumping involves depositing all the waste materials from factories and industries, tankers and ships and sewerage waste materials into the oceans and seas. Some of the materials emitted by the industrial wastes and sewage wastes contain materials like mercury, cryolite and DDT. Certain industrial wastage also includes radioactive materials. Even small amounts of these substances tend to have negative effects.The scale and the magnitude of the ocean dumping are not just vast but are so huge, that our entire civilisation could be wiped out with the intensity of careless dumping.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>4. Industries</h3>
				<img src="photos/industry.jpg" alt="Industry image">
				<p>The world's water is being used as an industrial toilet bowl. Industries discharge massive amounts of the most toxic pollutants- human waste into the water system. The construction and continual operation of power plants, particularly those fueled by fossil fuels can have profound impacts on water quality and supply. Many toxic synthetic chemicals that cannot be broken down at all by natural processes are deliberately introduced to our water systems. Even in tiny amounts, some of these substances can cause serious harm to people, plants and animals.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>5. Radioactive waste</h3>
				<img src="photos/radioactive.jpg"  alt="radioactive water waste">
				<p>Certainly radiation can enter the food chain though plankton and kelp and then go on to contaminate fish.  Radioactive caesium and plutonium has already been found in seals and porpoises in the Irish Sea. On 11th March 2011 the tragic earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan caused major damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.  This natural disaster caused thousands of tons of radioactive water to be released into the Pacific Ocean.  </p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>6. agricultural waste</h3>
				<img src="photos/agricultural.jpg" alt="agricultural waste">
				<p>Agriculture, which accounts for 70 percent of water withdrawals worldwide, plays a major role in water pollution. Farms discharge large quantities of agrochemicals, organic matter, drug residues, sediments and saline drainage into water bodies. from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) program led by the International Water Management Institute  – exploding demand for food with high environmental footprints, such as meat from industrial farms, is contributing to unsustainable agricultural intensification and to water-quality degradation.</p>

				<h1>5 effects of water pollution</h1>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>1. Destruction of flora and fauna</h3>
				<img src="photos/Flora and Fauna.jpg" alt="Flora and Fauna Destruction">
				<p>There are countless species of plants and animals which depend upon water for their survival, making them the most susceptible to water pollution. The 2010 Deep Horizon oil spill, for example, adversely affected over 82,000 birds, 6,000 turtles, 25,900 marine mammals and an unquantified number of fish and invertebrates. Meanwhile, other forms of pollution can destroy the carefully balanced ecosystems and habitats of water-dwelling organisms, wiping out entire species altogether.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>2. Drinking water supplies</h3>
				<img src="photos/dirty drinking water.jpg" alt="Dirty Drinking Water">
				<p>Contaminating the sources from which we draw our drinking water supplies over the centuries means that 2.1 billion people – or just over a quarter of the world’s population – do not have access to safe drinking water. In fact, despite massive advances in innovative online water quality monitoring in drinking water networks, even prosperous countries can find themselves at the mercy of unclean drinking water.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>3. Food chain disruption</h3>
				<img src="photos/food chain.jpg" alt="Food Chain Disruption">
				<p>Microscopic pollution of a body of water as big as the Pacific Ocean might seem negligible, but tiny microplastics, chemicals, heavy metals and other contaminants can be ingested by microorganisms and interfere with their inner organs. These are then consumed by larger animals and so pollution gradually works it way up the food chain. At some point, it’s feasible for the contaminants to wipe out a link altogether, or else reach the very top of the pyramid by compromising human health.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>4. agricultural downfall</h3>
				<img src="photos/withered crops.jpg" alt="Withered Crops">
				<p>The delicate balance between water and agriculture is critical to the environment, so it’s imperative that the water used for irrigation of crops and sustenance of livestock is kept scrupulously clean. Failure to do so could damage the nutritional value of the yields produced by farmers or, worse yet, make them toxic to humans. Even if the problem is recognised before it can cause too much damage, the scarcity of water in the period while it is being resolved could lead to a drop-off in yields and result in food poverty for the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>5. Economic downturn</h3>
				<img src="photos/downturn.jpg" alt="Economic Downturn">
				<p>So far, all of the above consequences of water pollution have focused on the health impacts – but the costs of water pollution can be financial, too. Last year, the Japanese authorities announced that they were running low on space to keep contaminated water supplies from the Fukushima power plant disaster under containment. Studies have indicated that it’s likely to cost the government a very minimum of $660 billion to completely clean up the fallout from the incident.</p>

				<h1>6 ways to lessen water pollution</h1>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>1. Dispose of Toxic Chemicals Properly:</h3>
				<img src="photos/chemical disposal.jpg" alt="proper chemical disposal">
				<p>Using recovered material generates less solid waste. Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by the extraction and processing of virgin materials. Also, when products are made using recovered rather than virgin materials, less energy is used during manufacturing, and fewer pollutants are emitted.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>2. Eat more organic food</h3>
				<img src="photos/organic.png" alt="organic food">
				<p>While chemicals can be used on organic foods, they tend to be produced with few synthetic chemicals. Eating organic reduces the amount of chemical pollution that ends up in the water. The food we choose to eat has a huge impact on environmental quality, between the chemicals used to grow food, the fuel used to transport the crops, and the fuel used to power farm equipment on industrial farms.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>3. Report Water Polluters</h3>
				<img src="photos/report.png" alt="report image">
				<p>Many cases of illegal waste disposal and other forms of water pollution go unreported and often aren’t cleaned up. Report people who pour oil in storm drains, toss bags of trash in a stream, and so on.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>4. avoid using plastic containers</h3>
				<img src="photos/no to plastic.jpg" alt="no to plastic photo">
				<p>Plastic shopping bags and plastic rings from six-packs of beverages cause inordinate problems in the nations lakes and seas. Plastic bottles can last for decades in the water. Buy some reusable cloth or plastic grocery bags instead. They can be had for as little as $1 each, so there is a minimal cost involved. Use reusable, insulated containers to hold drinks and make your own filtered water at home.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>5. Plant Some Trees</h3>
				<img src="photos/platn.jpg" alt="tree image">
				<p>Trees reduce erosion that washes pollution into the water and reduces erosion. You can also volunteer your time in a local tree-planting effort. If you own land along a river or pond, plant trees, bushes, or grass along the bank.</p>
				<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
				<h3>6. Support Environmental Charities</h3>
				<img src="photos/support.jpg" alt="support image">
				<p>No matter where you live in the country, there are going to be charities working on watershed protection, water pollution cleanup, and similar causes. Find an organization that’s active in your area and make a donation every year. Your support may even lead to expanded anti-pollution work.</p>
